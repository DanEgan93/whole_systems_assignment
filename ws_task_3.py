	Whole Systems Assignment

	Task 2- Using the list of genes from task 2 extract information from ClinVar 
	and dbSNP. For each gene in your list, create a text file containing:
		1) All the SNPs within those genes that are in CLinVar and dbSNP
		2) The clinical significance of each of the SNPs 
		3) The disease or phenotype with which each of the SNPs is associated

	Note- The list of genes used for this excercise will be the genes extracted
	from the STRING database. This decision was made as this will limit the number
	or requests to the Entrez API.
